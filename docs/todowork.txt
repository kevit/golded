mail.

GoldED+ plans. As always there's no any guarantee of feature
implementation order and that to do list will be implemented at all.
Any help will be appreciated.
______________________________________________________________________

To do:

* Treat empty description as no description in Areafile parser.
* Deleting Synchronet messages, forward reply linking.
* Add Synchronet message base support (aim for 1.1.5).
* AreaYouWroteTo should be able to store copy of mail after change.
* Optionally add complete set of fidonet kludges to AreaIsEmail.
* E-mail/news signature support (or it already present? :))
* Refresh message header after calling externutil.
* Try to save position in message after printing, changing xlat table,
  etc.
* Major xlat/recode engine update (in progress).
* CUI in input prompts.
* Activating built-in MIME-QP convertor by key (on whole message).
* Postpone.
* Highlight up to 3 groups of users by different color.
* Implicit address completion in addressbook.
* Addressbook sorting in various ways.
* Addressbook <-> macrofile synchronization
* Mouse support
* Better threading support.
* Read unread messages (either will be done via selection of unread
  messages or when storing of unread status will be implemented).
* Add separators to Arealistformat, i.e. Arealistformat "A|E|G".
* Entering to locked area should allow to select another area instead.
* CODEPAGE kludge support.
* Switching code page at message reading using information from CHRS kludge
  (some OS only).
* Message text preprocessing with externutil.
* Add *.* (DOS-based) or * (*nix) to attach path if not specified.
* Marking messages with reply in lister.
* Macro-tokens (@token like externutil parameters) in TaskTitle
* Select areas in crosspost menu.
* Replace prinf format string with special macrovariables in goldlang.cfg
  (prevent Golded+ crash with invalid config, improve functionality of
  goldlang.cfg parser).
* Big-endian platforms support.
* Insert from pipe in internal editor.
* Create directory three for output file if not exists.

To fix:

* UUdecoder not 100% reliable: any volunteers for uulib maintaining?
* Need some workarounds on -install feature under UNIX-like OS.

Known wishes that not currently planned (any volunteers?):

* Interactive Twit-list edition.
* Pass areaname, message number, etc. to external utility.
* Hide empty areas / areas without new messages from arealist.
* SMTP support.
* NNTP support.
* Forward multiple messages.
* Peeking up message from area while in edit mode.
* Screen grabber.
* Language support for menu (ReadMainMenu).
* Mark areas with unsent mail.
* Trashcan for mail.
* Selection of codepage for outgoing message.
* Ability to change directory in attach picker.
