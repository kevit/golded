1. Don't you forgot that instalation of new version requires reading of
   notework.txt?

2. GoldED+ requires that your system environment properly configured for your
   local rules: you should have properly configured locale (with country.sys,
   Control Panel or LANG environment variable) and timezone info (with TZ
   environment variable or Control Panel).

3. To replace SoftCR with something on typing you should use EditSoftCRXlat
   and DispSoftCR keywords. Starting from the version 1.1.3 you shouldn't
   expirience significant problems with it.

4. "Hi-ASCII-Char ...Macro ..." no longer works in old fashion due to
   'Hi-ASCII-Char' considered as case-insensitive character like it always
   was done for ASCII characters.

5. GoldED+ displays stylecode chars like GoldED 2.50 by default. If you don't
   like this behaviour then take a look at StyleCodes keyword.

6. To use CUA with "KeybDefaults No" you should define it. Though various
   #Left is not described in manual they present ;-) I'll describe it when
   it will be implemented in Linux version.

7. If you have a problem with incorrect recoding in message lister try
   add "MsgListFast No" to your config.

8. In order to make usable backspace in Linux version add following to your
   keymap if not yet: ``keycode 14 = delete delete delete delete''

9. If you want add something to this file - feel free to contact me.
